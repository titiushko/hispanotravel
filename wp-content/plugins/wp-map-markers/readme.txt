WP Map Markers is a plugin that brings the Google Maps Store locator library to your WordPress website. It uses the v3 API.

== Description ==

Add new locations like posts with the Location custom post type. Display maps on your posts and pages with a simple shortcode.

Create an unlimited number of maps and display markers on them with infobubbles that show the post thumbnail and other useful information.

The map interface lists locations near you and allows you to search with autocomplete and filter by features. The features are terms from a custom Feature taxonomy. Add as many filters as you like.

Choose from different marker icons.

**Follow this plugin on [Git Hub](http://pdewouters.github.com/WP-Map-Markers/)**

== New in version 1.1 ==

Add your own custom marker icons by uploading them via FTP to wp-content/plugins/wp-map-markers/markers

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

First, check the default settings on the Map Markers setting page
Create a map under the Maps section, not forgetting to provide the default map center coordinates. 
You can use the map on the settings page to get the latitude and longitude, and copy/paste them.

Add a few locations ( just like adding posts )
Insert a map on a page or post by using the wpmm_map shortcode.
Multiple maps on same page is not supported

Insert a map easily by selecting it from a dropdown menu located in the post editor

== Shortcode ==
Ex: [wpmm_map map="1"] where "1" is the ID of the Map found in the Map category for the locations.

The map slug is found on the list of maps page. 
Maps is a custom taxonomy
